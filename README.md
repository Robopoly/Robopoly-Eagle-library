## Library
The `robopoly.lbr` contains all the non-standard electrical components used in the kit PRisme for [Eagle](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/?language=en) PCB making software. Components used for the [PRismino](https://github.com/Robopoly/PRismino), [Robopoly Shield](https://github.com/Robopoly/Robopoly-Shield) and the [Power Board](https://github.com/Robopoly/Power-Board) are all included.

## SketchUp
With [Eagle CAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/?language=en) it's possible to export PCB files to view them in 3D in Google SketchUp. To do so a plug-in script must be downloaded for Eagle to export the file and SketchUp to build the 3D mesh from [eagleUp website](http://eagleup.wordpress.com/). The SketchUp file names must correspond with the component package name for them to be loaded automatically.

Follow the [tutorial on eagleUp's website](http://eagleup.wordpress.com/tutorial-v4/) to install the plug-ins and 3D files.
